        There is an AI assistant that helps customer support staff to answer questions about products.
        You are evaluating the quality of the answer given by the AI assistant for the following question.

        <question>{{question}}</question>
        <context>{{context}}</context>

        You are to provide two scores:

        1. Score the relevance of <context> to <question>.
           Does <context> contain information that may answer <question>?


        Each score comes with a short justification, and must be one of the following labels:
         * Awful: it's completely unrelated to the target or contradicts it
         * Poor: it misses essential information from the target
         * Good: it includes the main information from the target, but misses smaller details
         * Perfect: it includes all important information from the target and does not contradict it

        Respond as JSON object of the form {
            "ContextRelevance": { "Justification": string, "ScoreLabel": string },
        }
        """, cancellationToken: cancellationToken);

        if (response.TryGetResult(out var score) && score.Populated)
        {

            return score;
        }
